This study describes cocultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and the influences of their heterotypic interactions on hydraulic conductivity (L p ), an important transport property. A unique feature of these cocultures is that ECs were first grown to confluence and then SMCs were inoculated. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cocultured on Transwell Permeable Supports, and then exposed to a pressure-driven transmural flow. L p across each culture was measured using a bubble tracking apparatus that determined water flux (J v ). Our results indicate that arterial L p is significantly modulated by EC-SMC proximity, and serum content in culture. The L p of cocultures was also compared to the predictions of a resistances-in-series model to distinguish the contributions of heterotypic interactions between SMCs and ECs. Conditions that lead to significantly reduced coculture L p , compared to BAEC monoculture controls, have been uncovered and the lowest L p in the literature for an in vitro system are reported. In addition, VE-cadherin immunostaining of intact BAEC monolayers in each culture configuration reveals that EC-SMC proximity on a porous membrane has a dramatic influence on EC morphology patterns. The cocultures with the lowest L p have ECs with significantly elongated morphology. Confocal imaging indicates that there are no direct EC-SMC contacts in coculture.</div>

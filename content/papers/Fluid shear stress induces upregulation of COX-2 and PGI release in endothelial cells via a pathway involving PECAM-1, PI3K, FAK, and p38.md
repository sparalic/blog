<div style="text-align: justify"> Determine the major mechanotransduction pathway by which blood flow-driven shear stress activates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) release in endothelial cells. Our work has demonstrated for the first time that COX-2/PGI2 mechanotransduction is mediated by the mechanosensor platelet endothelial cell adhesion mole- cule-1 (PECAM-1).</div>

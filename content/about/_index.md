{{< figure src="/images/Sparkle.png" title="My journey from Chemical Engineering to Data Science!" >}}

<div style="text-align: justify;">I am a rouge Chemical/Biomedical Engineer turned Data Scientist. I obtained my BS and MS in Chemical Engineering at New York University and my PhD. in Biomedical Engineering at The City College of New York. My  thesis research focused on identifying cellular and molecular targets that can be utilized for the development of tools to prevent, diagnose, and treat heart related diseases such as arteriosclerosis. I strive to further expand my background by combining my expertise in engineering, biology and data science to extract insight from data sets that can improve upon the current technologies and provide solutions that significantly contribute to tools that improves lives. </div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I am  a proud Trinidadian, who enjoys spending time with family and close friends ...if I am not traveling.</div>

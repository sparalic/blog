      <description>Background: Detailed review of Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Nets (Choi et.al 2016)
by: Sparkle Russell-Puleri and Dorian Puleri
Electronic medical records( EMRs), which is sometimes interchangeably called Electronic health records(EHRs) are primarily used to electronically-store patient health data digitally. While the use of these systems seem commonplace today, most notably due to the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2014.</description>

In part one of this tutorial series, we demonstrated the matrix operations used to estimate the hidden states and outputs for the forward pass of a GRU. Based on our poor results, we obviously need to optimize our algorithm and test it on a test set to ensure generalizability. This is typically done using several steps/techniques. In this tutorial we will walkthrough what happens under the hood during optimization, specifically calculating the loss function and performing backpropagation through time to update the weights over several epochs.</description>

Often times we get consumed with using Deep learning frameworks that perform all of the required operations needed to build our models. However, there is some value to first understanding some of the basic matrix operations used under the hood. In this tutorial we will walk you through the simple matrix operations needed to understand how a GRU works.
A detailed notebook can be found at: Sparkle&amp;rsquo;s or Dorian&amp;rsquo;s Github page.</description>

      <description>Are you an avid outdoor explorer? Well this classifier can help you identify America&amp;rsquo;s top 10 poisonous plants, so that you can spend your time enjoying the outdoors.This web app can help you identify these pesky show stoppers by simply uploading an image of the any of these 10 culprits for confirmation.
Update: I am working on porting this to a mobile app
Here is an screen shot of the first iteration of the webapp:   </description>

      <description>My journey from Chemical Engineering to Data Science!   I am a rouge Chemical/Biomedical Engineer turned Data Scientist. I obtained my BS and MS in Chemical Engineering at New York University and my PhD. in Biomedical Engineering at The City College of New York. My thesis research focused on identifying cellular and molecular targets that can be utilized for the development of tools to prevent, diagnose, and treat heart related diseases such as arteriosclerosis.</description>

      <description>Background: Detailed review of Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Nets (Choi et.al 2016)
by: Sparkle Russell-Puleri and Dorian Puleri
Electronic medical records( EMRs), which is sometimes interchangeably called Electronic health records(EHRs) are primarily used to electronically-store patient health data digitally. While the use of these systems seem commonplace today, most notably due to the passing of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act in 2014.</description>

In part one of this tutorial series, we demonstrated the matrix operations used to estimate the hidden states and outputs for the forward pass of a GRU. Based on our poor results, we obviously need to optimize our algorithm and test it on a test set to ensure generalizability. This is typically done using several steps/techniques. In this tutorial we will walkthrough what happens under the hood during optimization, specifically calculating the loss function and performing backpropagation through time to update the weights over several epochs.</description>

Often times we get consumed with using Deep learning frameworks that perform all of the required operations needed to build our models. However, there is some value to first understanding some of the basic matrix operations used under the hood. In this tutorial we will walk you through the simple matrix operations needed to understand how a GRU works.

      <description>Are you an avid outdoor explorer? Well this classifier can help you identify America&amp;rsquo;s top 10 poisonous plants, so that you can spend your time enjoying the outdoors.This web app can help you identify these pesky show stoppers by simply uploading an image of the any of these 10 culprits for confirmation.
Update: I am working on porting this to a mobile app
Here is an screen shot of the first iteration of the webapp:   </description>

      <title>Fluid shear stress induces upregulation of COX-2 and PGI release in endothelial cells via a pathway involving PECAM-1, PI3K, FAK, and p38.</title>

      <description>Determine the major mechanotransduction pathway by which blood flow-driven shear stress activates cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandin I2 (PGI2) release in endothelial cells. Our work has demonstrated for the first time that COX-2/PGI2 mechanotransduction is mediated by the mechanosensor platelet endothelial cell adhesion mole- cule-1 (PECAM-1).

      <title>Hydraulic Conductivity of Smooth Muscle Cell-Initiated Arterial Cocultures.</title>
      <link>http://sparalic.github.io/papers/hydraulic-conductivity-of-smooth-muscle-cell-initiated-arterial-cocultures/</link>

      <description>The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of arterial coculture conditions on the transport properties of several in vitro endothelial cell (EC)-smooth muscle cell (SMC)-porous filter constructs in which SMC were grown to confluence first and then EC were inoculated. This order of culturing simulates the environment of a blood vessel wall after endothelial layer damage due to stenting, vascular grafting or other vascular wall insult. For all coculture configurations examined, we observed that hydraulic conductivity (L(p)) values were significantly higher than predicted by a resistances-in-series (RIS) model accounting for the L(p) of EC and SMC measured separately.</description>

      <title>Hydraulic conductivity of endothelial cell-initiated arterial cocultures.</title>

      <description>This study describes cocultures of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and endothelial cells (ECs) and the influences of their heterotypic interactions on hydraulic conductivity (L p ), an important transport property. A unique feature of these cocultures is that ECs were first grown to confluence and then SMCs were inoculated. Bovine aortic smooth muscle cells and bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cocultured on Transwell Permeable Supports, and then exposed to a pressure-driven transmural flow.</description>

      <title>Improved agarose gel electrophoresis method and molecular mass calculation for high molecular mass hyaluronan.</title>

      <description>The molecular mass of the polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) is an important determinant of its biological activity and physicochemical properties. One method currently used for the analysis of the molecular mass distribution of an HA sample is gel electrophoresis. In the current work, an improved agarose gel electrophoresis method for analysis of high molecular mass HA is presented and validated. HA mobility in 0.5% agarose minigels was found to be linearly related to the logarithm of molecular mass in the range from approximately 200 to 6000 kDa.</description>
